## Install

Run

python setup.py install

If you don't have permission to install software on your system, you can install
into another directory using the --prefix or --home flags to setup.py.

For example
::
python setup.py install --prefix=/home/username/python
or
python setup.py install --home=~
::

If you didn't install in the standard bin directory
you will need to set your PATH variable to the alternate location.

If you didn't install in the standard Python site-packages directory
you will need to set your PYTHONPATH variable to the alternate location.
See http://docs.python.org/inst/search-path.html for further details.
