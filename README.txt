ABOUT

DLCpar is a reconciliation program that maps a gene tree to a species tree
by inferring gene duplications, losses, and coalescence (accounting for
incomplete lineage sorting).  DLCpar uses the labeled coalescent tree (LCT)
to infer the species and locus to which a gene belongs.

This package includes the Python source code of the DLCpar program,
as well as several useful utilities for working with LCTs.

CITATION

In general, cite the following paper:
Wu, Rasmussen, Bansal, Kellis. Most Parsimonious Reconciliation in the
Presence of Gene Duplication, Loss, and Deep Coalescence using Labeled
Coalescent Trees. Genome Research (24)3:475-486, 2014.

random sampling:

and Coalescence. In prep.

If you are using the ILP formulation:
